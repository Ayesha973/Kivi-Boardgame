Project Overview
This repository contains a runnable Java JAR file that can be executed from any terminal/console. It is a computerized version of the KIVI Board Game, a fun and accessible game for 2-4 players, featuring human-vs-human or human-vs-computer modes. The game was developed using Agile methodologies, allowing iterative improvements and team collaboration.

Game Description

2, 3, or 4 players (human-vs-human or human-vs-computer).
A computer player with two difficulty levels: Easy and Hard.
The ability to save and resume games, enabling players to continue later.
Special design considerations for color vision deficiency to ensure inclusivity and accessibility for all players.
The game will be designed for adults and children, focusing on user-friendly visuals and intuitive gameplay while being adaptable for future networked versions.

Key Features
Multiplayer Modes: 2-player, 3-player, or 4-player games.
